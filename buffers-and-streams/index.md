The Node Application Developer Certification exam section for Buffers and Streams is worth 11% of the total and is broken into the following sections.

The topics that are covered include:

- Node.js Buffer APIâ€™s
- Incremental Processing
- Transforming Data
- Connecting Streams

## Buffers and Streams Overview

The Node.js APIS [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v10.x/api/buffer.html) and [Stream](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v10.x/api/stream.html) are fundamentally seperate topics yet are intrinsically linked. This section will cover how these APIs work individually and with each other.

### Buffer

The Node.js Buffer class implements buffers which are fixed size chunks of memory outside the V8 heap. Buffers are used to deal with binary data when dealing with TCP streams and reading/writing to the file system.

### Stream

The Node.js Stream module provides an API for working with streaming data. Streams are a fundamental concept in, and are prevalent throughout applications built on, Node. Streams are an efficient way to handle sending and receiving data particularly for large or indeterminate amounts of data.

> In computer science, a data buffer (or just buffer) is a region of a physical memory storage used to temporarily store data while it is being moved from one place to another.
